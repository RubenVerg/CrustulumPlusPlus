# Crustulum++
Crustulum is a *cheating* add-on for [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It enables a variety of features to help those wishing to make aspects of the game easier. Instead, in Crustulum++, only *some* of the features (mostly the ones inherited from Crustulum) are to be considered 'cheaty'. The 'Cheated cookies taste awful' achievement is given once a cheating action/toggle is used.

## NOTE: CURRENTLY CHEATS DON'T GIVE THE ACHIEVEMENT, WILL FIX SOON(TM)

### Notice for the original Crustulum
I wrote all the code [myself](github.com/Ancyker), though the original Cookie Clicker code was obviously used in some places. I also looked at Cookie Monster for reference on how to make buttons appear in the menu.
